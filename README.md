# 🎙️ Wakeup Jarvis – Web Voice Assistant 🔊

A futuristic, minimal web-based voice assistant that activates with custom hotwords like `"wake up"`, `"jarvis"`, `"ayushi"` and more. Once triggered, it listens to your voice, speaks back your command, and returns to sleep mode. Fully browser-based. No APIs. No backend.

🌐 **Live Demo:** [Wakeup-Jarvis](https://aashoosharma.github.io/Wakeup-jarvis/)  
🛠 Built with: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (Web Speech API)

## 🚀 Features

- 🎧 **Multiple Wake Words:**  
  `"wake up"`, `"jarvis"`, `"ayushi"`, `"hello assistant"`, `"hey buddy"`

- 🗣️ **Voice Reply:**  
  Echoes your spoken command using speech synthesis.

- 🌙 **Auto Sleep Mode:**  
  Returns to passive mode after each interaction.

- 🔒 **100% Client-Side:**  
  No data is sent to any server — completely private.

- 📱 **Mobile & Desktop Support:**  
  Works best in Google Chrome (Android & PC).

## 🧠 How It Works

1. Assistant runs silently in sleep mode.
2. Listens continuously in the background.
3. On hearing any hotword, it activates and responds.
4. Then it listens to your next voice command and replies.
5. Goes back to sleep mode automatically.
